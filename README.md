This is a gui plugin for Minecraft.
It should work on every version 1.16 - 1.21.4 (not tested yet)
So far, in version 1.0.0 of the plugin, i only made the basics. Menu navigation my levels of priority, Command usage tested with granting gamemode creative to targeted player ( this was made to test the passing ), and some other basic functions.
